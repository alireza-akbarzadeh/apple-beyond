## Introduction

React Launchpad is a modern React project starter setup aimed at simplifying the initial setup for React projects. It provides a streamlined starting point with pre-configured tools and dependencies to kickstart your development process.



## Getting Started

To get started with this app, follow these steps:

1. Fork & clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/react-launchpad.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.




> [!NOTE]  
> I use [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) package for update this project.
>
> Use this command for update your project: `ncu -i --format group`

> [!WARNING]  
> You need update `.react-email` folder before use `pnpm run email`. Check the link [here](https://github.com/resend/react-email/issues/868#issuecomment-1828411325) if you have the error : `renderToReadableStream not found`
>
> After upgrade Auth.js to v5: `NEXTAUTH_URL` has removed from `.env.example`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Errors while the build if you update `remark-gfm` package.
